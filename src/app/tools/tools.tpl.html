            <p>Appart from <span class="text-green">AngularJS</span>, here are some tools I'm currently playing with and that I love:</p>
            <ul class="technos">
              <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack">Webpack</a></strong> is one of those tools you can't imagine living without anymore. It builds, lints and bundles your code, transpiles es6 on the go etc in an incredibly efficient fashion. Grunt and Gulp seem so far away ...</li>
              <li><strong><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a></strong> is a revolution in the front-end environment. I love server rendering, native mobile development in javascript as well as what it allows once combined with other technologies: hot module replacement, unidirectional dataflow and so on.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/rackt/redux">Redux</a></strong> is a minimalistic library implementing a flux-like data flow in your application. This is a beautiful solution to managing the state of your application. I just LOVE it.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/">Immutable</a></strong> is going very well with the two previous ones. It enforces you to use a unidirectional functionnal flow. I am a fan of the philosophy.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/">ES6 and ES7 with Babel</a></strong> there is no coming back after trying new es6-7 features.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="http://koajs.com/">Koa</a></strong> is a very interesting Node server based on co.js routine, making great use of new ES6 generators.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="https://bitcoin.org">Bitcoin</a></strong>. Pretty much un-related, but I've been digging into the blockchain a little, and I'm very keen on trying to make some apps with it!</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div class="lead">that I want to try soon</div>
            <p>Here are also some technologies I would like to investigate:</p>
            <ul class="technos">
              <li><strong><a href="http://reactivex.io/">RxJS</a></strong> observables look just amazing. They are like promises flows, perfect for managing apps with a lot of notifications and live client updates for example.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular2</a></strong> seems fairly promising.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a></strong>. Used by Angular2, Typescript seem to provide a great set of dev tool that I would like to try.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/">GraphQL and Relay</a></strong> are Facebook answer to the problems of data fetching. I'm very eager to try.</li>
              <li>...</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Hello !</h2>
        <p>My name is Alexandre Herv√©. I'm a 26 year old javascript developer and entrepreneur.</p>
        <p>I got caught into the web a couple of years ago as I was working on a startup project after my engineering school. We were helping students choose the best studies for them.</p> 
        <p>I stayed in the web environment as it came to an end, doing multiple freelance jobs as well as a 5 months experience in Berlin by a very fine company called Small Improvements.</p>
        <p>I'm now back in Paris, and Im looking for a javascript position.</p>
        <p>I am a hard worker, and a fast learner. Please feel free to contact me :-)</p>
